# udemy_webdevbootcamp
All my course work and sandboxes from the web dev bootcamp on Udemy.

The final project of the course is "v13" in the "YelpCamp" directory.

Throughout the course I learned or reviewed the following technologies and some of which are reflected in these files.

    HTML5
    CSS3
    JavaScript
    Bootstrap
    SemanticUI
    DOM Manipulation
    jQuery
    Unix(Command Line) Commands
    NodeJS
    NPM
    ExpressJS
    REST
    MongoDB
    Database Associations
    Authentication
    PassportJS
    Authorization
    
All app.js files are configured to run on Cloud9 which is the cloud based IDE I use. 
If you wish to run the app, change the app.listen in the app.js file to connect to your port and local host.
You will also need to do an "npm install" and have MongoDB.
